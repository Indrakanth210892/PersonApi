# PersonApiMarsIndia

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.11]


## Running the application in IDE

As this is a Spring Boot application I would recommend STS IDE to begin with and import this as a maven project. You can right click on the project and run as Spring Boot App.

## Running the application locally

To run the application is to run the jar available in the target folder. PersonApiMarsIndia/target/PersonApiMarsIndia-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar is the location of the jar.
In command prompt go to the target folder and execute this command: java -jar PersonApiMarsIndia-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Running the Test Cases locally

Please make sure you run the test case with Junit4 instead of the default Junit5 as shown Configuration.PNG in the root folder of this project.

## Checking code coverage

Ideally I would integrate sonar qube but for the sake of time I have used eclemma to show the sample coverage for one class I wrote. Please refer the Coverage.PNG in the root folder of this project.


## Business functionality

As per the requirements this API provides a Command-Line Interface and also SUPPORTS RESTFUL services. It supports both JSON and XML (Nice to have features specified in the requirements document).


## Endpoints

Once the application is up and running please use the following SWAGGER-UI urls for reference:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs

Please note the required features I have implemented on a sample basis to showcase that I am aware of these techniques. For instance I have used logging in one method as a sample. I have used Swagger API description for one method to show I know it. I wrote test cases to give 100% percent coverage for one class.
I have done whatever is required within the time limits so as to showcase the panel that I am aware of these technologies. Please consider this as a minimal-functional model only.
